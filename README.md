# Customer Behavior Prediction

This is a machine learning project that uses Python to predict customer behavior. The project uses historical data to train a model that can then be used to predict future customer behavior.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following software installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/AnjaliAshokR/project.git


Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells. You can also open the .py file and run the script in your local environment.

## Data

The data used in this project is a sample dataset of customer behavior. It includes information such as customer demographics and purchase history. Also done exploratory data ananalysis for the detail study of the dataset

## Model

The models used in this project are Random Forest Classifier, Logistic regression, decision tree and K nearest neighbour.

## Results

The model results are computed using confusion metrix, f1 score and accuracy score
